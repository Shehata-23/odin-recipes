            <li>Combine 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan over high heat.</li>
            <li>Bring to a boil; stir until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium; add lime juice.</li>
            <li>Simmer until flavors combine, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir 1 teaspoon vanilla extract into the syrup; let cool.</li>

            <li>Reduce heat to medium. Add flour; stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until batter forms into a ball.</li>

            <li>Flatten batter into the bottom of the bowl. Add eggs, 1 at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Stir in remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; mix until batter is creamy. Pour into a cloth piping bag fitted with a large star tip.
